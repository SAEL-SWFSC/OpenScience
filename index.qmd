Open Science is a movement to make scientific research (including
publications, data, software) transparent and accessible so that
knowledge is shared. This repository provides resources to help NOAA
Fisheries Passive Acoustic Monitoring groups adopt an **Open Science**
approach to their research.

Public access to knowledge is a fundamental component of Open Science
that often takes a back seat to open access to methods and data. The
open sharing of knowledge not only helps our future selves, it also
helps serves to lessen the inequities inherent in scientific research.
When we learn something new, we should consider how we can share this
information. Here we give advice on sharing knowledge through
BioAcoustics Stack Exchange (a public Q & A platform) and with Zotero
Libraries (shared public libraries to identify reports and
publications).

Co-working allows researchers to work together in time and/or space to
provide motivation, accountability, and assistance. There are any number
of ways to co-work, and here we provide a few suggestions to conduct
co-working sprints or writers workshops.

This section contains methods for adopting an Open Science broken up
into specific goals, including: Creating a Lab Manual, Developing a
Github Organization, and creating a Research Compendium.
