Github Discussions are a collaborative communication forum for the community around an open source or internal project. Community members can ask and answer questions, share updates, and more. Rather than create a new discussion, we will work together within our Open Science Discussion board to learn new ways of working together as a team.

## Working in Discussions

Here we will identify several different ways of working within discussions, and practice with those ways. For each example, we will have a lead who initiates the task, and then all other members will collaborate. Our goal is to work with Github Discussions in this [space]{.underline}, in order to identify how it will work for our own teams.

1.  **Ideas -** Ideas to change or improve the project (Open-ended discussion)

*Example:* Does anyone have an idea on helpful things to add to lab manual?

2.  **Polls-** Polls with multiple options for the community to vote or discuss (Polls)

*Example:* Give a few options for next steps in Github after the Lab Manual (Research Compendium, Repo for Repeated Reports, Project Boards for Analysis Management, Writing NMFS Reports, other)

3.  **Q&A-** Questions for the community to answer, with a question/answer format (Question & Answer)

*Example:* Do you need 1:1 help with your Lab Manual?

4.  Show and Tell- Creations, experiments, or tests relevant to the project (Open-ended discussion)

*Example:* Jennifer McCullough can add info/links to add NMFS Logos to their documents

5.  **Announcements-** Updates and news from project maintainers (Announcement)

*Example:* Add announcement: Openscapes Show & Tell for PAM-SI and community, IRA PAM SI Team Meeting, Wednesday, December 11, ⋅1:00 – 2:00pm Pacific Time

6.  **General-** Anything relevant to the project (Open-ended discussion)
