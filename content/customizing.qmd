## Quarto documentation

Quarto allow many bells and whistles to make nice output. Read the documentation here [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/){target="_blank"}.

## Examples

Looking at other people's Quarto code is a great way to figure out how to do stuff. Most will have a link to a GitHub repo where you can see the raw code. Look for a link to edit page or see source code. This will usually be on the right. Or look for the GitHub icon somewhere.

* [quarto-titlepages](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/quarto_titlepages/){target="_blank"} Note the link to edit is broken. Go to repo and look in `documentation` directory.
