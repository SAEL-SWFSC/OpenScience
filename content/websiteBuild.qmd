When building a repo where a website is the primary output, we recommend building from a template to ensure you are starting with a functional site to build on.

# Use NOAA Website Template
Go to Website Repository on Github: https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/NOAA-quarto-simple

Follow directions to use this as a template: https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/NOAA-quarto-simple/
