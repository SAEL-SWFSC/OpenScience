        -   [SEFSC specific user agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HQBJFCa55inDFNdB-TEYkEw6h0rUPAG0/view); [NEFSC specific user agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YBD_tZQ0zTjG6FkClegp2N-joDjB8tBg/view?usp=drive_link)

    2.  [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (v2022.07.2 build 576 or later)

    3.  [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

    4.  [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)

    5.  Create a [Github Account](https://github.com/)

2.  **Request to join the PAM-SI Meeting Repository**

    1.  Go to the PAM-SI Meeting Github Repository (<https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/PAM-SI-Mtg-March2024>)

    2.  Create an Issue to request to join the repository.

        1.  Select **âŠ™ Issue** (issue button) at the upper left, below the repository name, and to the right of the **\<\>Code** button

        2.  Select New Issue (green button to right) - Title = "Add me to Repository", and in the Description, give your name, email, and Github name.

        3.  click 'Submit New Issue'. I will add you to the repository as soon as I am able. Please ensure that you have your notifications set so that you will receive an email when you have been added, or when you are tagged in that repository.

    3.  When you have been added to the repository, go to the next step

3.  **Clone PAM-SI Meeting Repository to your local computer using Github Desktop:**

    1.  Open Github Desktop on the computer you will be bringing to the workshop

    2.  File -\> Clone Repository -\> URL

    3.  Paste in the URL for the PAM-SI Meeting Repo (provide link here). Save to your Documents -\> Github folder using the defaults. *It is highly recommended that you save Github Repository/RStudio Projects to these default locations (and for these instructions, we assume you will!).* See [Introduction to Git/Github tutorial](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/PSAW-2022/) for more help.

4.  **Create/Open project in RStudio.**

    1.  Open RStudio

    2.  In the upper right hand corner of RStudio, select 'New Project' in the drop-down menu

    3.  Add a new R Project from an Existing Project. Browse to find the appropriate folder in Documents-\> Github. *Note: Anytime you want to navigate to this project in RStudio, you can select it from the dropdown in this top right corner. If you want to use a new computer, you will need to repeat the steps of cloning the repository using Github Desktop, then creating a new project in RStudio.*

5.  **Modify Document *(Under Construction)***

    1.  In the lower right section of RStudio, navigate to 'Files' and 'Content'. Find and Open the 'Attendees.qmd' file in RStudio (insert Screenshot)

    2.  In the newer RStudio, you can use the Quarto Visual Editor to modify documents. Please navigate to the 'Visual' editor (insert screenshot) to make modifications.

    3.  Add your name in BOLD, your affiliation in Italics, with a link to your lab or personal website, insert a picture of you, give a one sentence explanation of the work you do with NOAA Fisheries.

    4.  Save the document

6.  **Commit & Push to Github.**

    1.  Open your project in Github Desktop; Github desktop will identify the changes you made (refresh if necessary).

    2.  At the bottom left, describe the modifications you made to the document, and then select 'commit'.

    3.  Once the commit goes through-- select 'Push to Origin' at the top. This will push changes to your Github repository.

    ***We will adopt this process as our daily habit of working on your projects locally and saving your data to Github. We will go through this process to actively work on the Meeting Report together, during the meeting. Our goal is to have it almost entirely finished by the end of the meeting!***
