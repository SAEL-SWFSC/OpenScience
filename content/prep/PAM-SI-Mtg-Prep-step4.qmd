    ***We will adopt this process as our daily habit of working on your projects locally and saving your data to Github. We will go through this process to actively work on the Meeting Report together, during the meeting. Our goal is to have it almost entirely finished by the end of the meeting!***

    *Note: In case you are wondering why this does not render to htmlâ€“ note that it is currently set to render to docx (in docs folder), and we are working on rendering to html.*
