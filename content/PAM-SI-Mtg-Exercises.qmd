## Working Meeting Notes

We will work as a team to work on meeting notes. After the meeting, the final meeting notes will be saved in the PAM-SI Meeting Repository (https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/PAM-SI-Mtg-March2024)

**Exercise:** Practice collaborating on meeting notes The purpose of this exercise is to get everyone involved in developing the meeting notes, and to engage in a few tips and tricks to make this process useful.

1.  Open the Meeting Notes in Google Docs (put link here)

2.  Tips for Team Google Docs

    1.  Newer Information on Top! (so we don't have to scroll and scroll to get to new info!)

    2.  If you like someone else's comment, put a +1 next to it (if there's already a +1, add another! +1 +1 +1)!!!

    3.  Add Links, Screenshots, Emojis, etc

    4.  During sessions, write notes, questions, comments in that section.

    5.  Have a question but don't want to interrupt? Ask it there! Have an answer? Provide it! Does it turn into a discussion? Go for it! We want to pay attention, but we also want to engage on several levels. If appropriate, we can stop to bring a written question/discussion into the meeting. These online discussions can be through comment threads related to a specific topic, or can be in the notes. Ultimately– these will be cleaned up so that the relevant information is retained. We all participate in this evolution!

    6.  Ultimately, we ALL share in meeting notes, so that all ideas, questions, comments, etc are included in the notes.

3.  Share something you learned/read recently (include links, comment or +1 others, etc)

## Github Collaboration

We will create our Workshop Report using our meeting Github Repository (https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/PAM-SI-Mtg-March2024). By all working together, we can have the bulk of the report completed by the end of the workshop. *Many hands make light work.*

Exercise: We will all work together on one small part of the report to fill in some of the information we know we will need. Assignments will be posted on the Google Doc. Find your assignment, and follow the instructions, below. Use the Google Doc for notes, and Github to work on your part of the Report.

1.  Introduction \[copy information from the proposal as starter for Introduction\]

2.  List of Attendees \[Names, emails, affiliations of everyone in the room– each person do part of the room\]

3.  Bibliography \[identify software, reports, and other documents we feel we will likely reference in this meeting. Add these to bibliography using Zotero, and update the report bibliography\]

4.  Acknowledgements \[Start a list of acknowledgements\]

At end of exercise, make sure everyone pushes their information up to Github, then we will render the output and view results. How long did it take us to work on that? Continue throughout the workshop, having one or more people draft the paper– we may want google docs for notes during any given session, but then one person summarize these notes into Github, and then others can edit/revise.
