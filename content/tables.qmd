Tables can be tricky to work with in quarto, this page (temporarily) serves as a testing space for inserting tables. Data for tables will be stored in OpenScience/data folder.

One way to insert a table is using the Child option (where this file is the 'Parent', and the code to create the table is in a separate 'child' R or Rmd file).

Example:

```{r bwTbl, child= "../data/bwTbl.Rmd"}


```
