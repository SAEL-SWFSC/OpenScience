        3.  In this position, write '- text/ListAttendees.qmd' (be sure there is only one space between the - and the word 'text')

    8.  Commit & Push to Github

        1.  Open Github Desktop, and in top left corner, use drop-down menu to select 'PAM-SI-Mtg-March2024' repository. Github desktop will identify the changes you made to the document.

        2.  At the bottom left, describe the modifications you made to the document, and then select 'commit'. For example, you may want to write "Add List of Attendees" and in details, state "Added List of Attendees table for Meeting report".

        3.  Once the commit goes through-- select 'Push to Origin' at the top. This will push changes to your Github repository.
