    2.  Open ListAttendees.qmd and set to Visual Editor

### Edit Attendees file

### Link ListAttendees.qmd to Report

1.  Open the \_quarto.yaml in the root directory and scroll down to the 'chapters'

3.  Once the commit goes through-- select 'Push to Origin' at the top. This will push changes to your Github repository.

4.  Open associated Github Issue [here](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/PAM-SI-Mtg-March2024/issues/12), and make sure you've completed all tasks
