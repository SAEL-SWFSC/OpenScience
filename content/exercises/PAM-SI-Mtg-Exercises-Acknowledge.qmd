        2.  At the bottom left, describe the modifications you made to the document, and then select 'commit'. For example, you may want to write "Add Acknowledgements" and in details, state "Added draft acknowledgements text".

        3.  Once the commit goes through-- select 'Push to Origin' at the top. This will push changes to your Github repository.
