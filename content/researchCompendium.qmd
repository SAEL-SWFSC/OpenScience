*Under Construction*

Goal: We will identify (or develop) a template repository to create a research compendium, along with a series of best practices.

## What is a Research Compendium?

A research compendium is a comprehensive collection of all the digital components related to a research project, including data, code, and text (protocols, reports, metadata, etc). 

## Conventions
By following suggested conventions, we can find our way around our own data, and also that of others who follow the same conventions.
