**Goal:** Describe Github organizations and teams, and identify their uses. 
- Identify PAM-SI teams within the OST PAM - Strategic Initiative Team. Add team members.
- Create a landing page for each PAM-SI team (see PAM-UxS page as an example), which will be updated as needed. This will serve as the primary go-to point for all components of the PAM-SI Team.
- Add additional repositories relevant to this team. See the PAM-UxS team as an example.
