## Getting Started with Github and RStudio Projects

Open Science is a movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, software) transparent and accessible so that knowledge is shared. Here we will provide steps to get started; in future sections we will provide additional details on specific tasks/projects

Embrace the Open Science Mindset! Learn more about this approach and why it matters at [Openscapes.org](https://openscapes.org/) and the [Openscapes Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/approach/).

## Add Software Tools

-   [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

-   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (v2022.07.2 build 576 or later)

-   [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

-   Create a [Github Login](https://github.com/)

## Create a NEW Repository from a template:

1.  Go to the Github Repository for the [PAM Lab Manual Template](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/PAM_template_lab_manual)

2.  Click on the 'Use this template' button in the top right, select 'Create new repository'

    ![](images/repoTemplate.png){width="296"}

3.  Edit repository settings

    -   Select the 'Include all branches' option

    -   Select your lab organization or yourself as the owner and set the repository name to 'Lab name Lab Manual'

    -   Make description "Lab manual for 'insert lab name and FMC'"

    -   Make the repo public

        ![](images/RepoSettings.png){width="280"}

4.  Click create repository

5.  Turn on GitHub pages under Settings-\>Pages. You will set pages to be made from the gh-pages branch and root directory

        ::: callout-important
        ## Note: Both of these settings may already be selected but you have to click save for both
        :::

7.  Return to the main page of the repo to edit your website

    -   Click on 'Code' in the top left

    -   Click on the settings button next to the 'About' section on the right side of the repository

    -   Select 'Use your GitHub Pages website'. This should autopopulate the website

    -   Select 'Save Changes'

## Clone Repository to Local Computer

Clone your Test Repository to your local computer using Github Desktop:

1.  File -\> Clone Repository -\> URL

2.  Copy URL of your chosen Repository on Github, then save to your Documents -\> Github folder using the defaults. See [Introduction to Git/Github tutorial](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/PSAW-2022/) for more help.

## Create a New Rstudio Project

1.  Create a new project in RStudio.

    -   Open RStudio. In the upper right hand corner of RStudio, select 'New Project' in the drop-down menu to add a new R Project from an Existing Project.

## Commit & Push to Github

1.  Commit & Push to Github.

    -   Save project in RStudio

    -   Open your project in Github Desktop; Github desktop will identify the changes you made (refresh if necessary).

        -   At the bottom left, describe the modifications you made to the document, and then select 'commit'.

        -   Once the commit goes through-- select 'Push to Origin' at the top. This will push changes to your Github repository.

2.  Check the updates on Github

    1.  Open your Github repository

    2.  Go to Actions Tab- is it rendering? did it go through (green) or fail (red)?

        ![](images/githubActionsSuccess.JPG){width="330"}

    3.  View the updated Github Repo ReadMe

    4.  View the updated Website Homepage

3.  Adopt this process as your daily habit of working on your projects locally and saving your data to Github.
