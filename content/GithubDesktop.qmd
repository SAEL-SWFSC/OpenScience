## Getting Started in Open Science

Open Science is a movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, software) transparent and accessible so that knowledge is shared. Here we will provide steps to get started; in future sections we will provide additional details on specific tasks/projects

1.  Embrace the Open Science Mindset! Learn more about this approach and why it matters at [Openscapes.org](https://openscapes.org/) and the [Openscapes Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/approach/).

2.  Add Software Tools

    -   [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

    -   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (v2022.07.2 build 576 or later)

    -   [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

    -   Create a [Github Login](https://github.com/)

3.  Identify the Github Repository you will use:

    -   Go to your repository on Github

    -   Create a Test Repository in Github (see help [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo))

4.  Clone your Test Repository to your local computer using Github Desktop:

    1.  File -\> Clone Repository -\> URL

    2.  Copy URL of your chosen Repository on Github, then save to your Documents -\> Github folder using the defaults. See [Introduction to Git/Github tutorial](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/PSAW-2022/) for more help.

5.  Create a new project in RStudio.

    -   Open RStudio. In the upper right hand corner of RStudio, select 'New Project' in the drop-down menu to add a new R Project from an Existing Project.

        ![](/images/rstudio_newProject.JPG){width="275"}

    -   Browse to find the appropriate folder in Documents-\> Github.

6.  Modify the README.md file.

    1.  In the lower right section of RStudio, select 'Files' and you will see the README.md file, which appears on the home page on your Github repository site.

        ![](/images/findReadMeFile.JPG){width="291"}

    2.  Open this file and edit using either Source Code or Visual Editor ![](/images/quartoEditors.JPG){width="211"}

        -   Add the title of your repository (using \# Title in Source Code or Heading 1 in Visual Editor)

        -   Add text below the title describing the contents/purpose of this repository

        -   Add the following Disclaimer and License (### Disclaimer if using Source Code):

            ![](/images/modifyReadMe.JPG){width="373"}

    3.  Save! This Readme will show up at the bottom of our Github Repository

7.  Modify the index.qmd file (home page)

    1.  Open the index.qmd file

    2.  ![](/images/findIndexFile.JPG){width="338"}

    3.  Modify using Source Editor to add a title and introductory text for the home page (for website). Title will need to be written in this format:

        ---

        title: "This is my title"

        ---

        ![](/images/modifyIndexforWebHomePage.JPG){width="554"}

8.  Commit & Push to Github.

    -   Save project in RStudio

    -   Open your project in Github Desktop; Github desktop will identify the changes you made (refresh if necessary).

        -   At the bottom left, describe the modifications you made to the document, and then select 'commit'.

        -   Once the commit goes through-- select 'Push to Origin' at the top. This will push changes to your Github repository.

9.  Check the updates on Github

    1.  Open your Github repository

    2.  Go to Actions Tab- is it rendering? did it go through (green) or fail (red)?

        ![](/images/githubActionsSuccess.JPG){width="367"}

    3.  View the updated Github Repo ReadMe

    4.  View the updated Website Homepage

10. Adopt this process as your daily habit of working on your projects locally and saving your data to Github.
